# A Manifesto for the Methodically Lazy: Jacked for No Reason

## Self-righteous Preamble from a Lucid Gymcel

I've been haunting my gym for over a decade now, and I'm still the same introverted and manic nerd, like some sort of melancholy ghost who forgot why I even began. I've always thrived in solitude, but it's still funny to think that the term **gymcel** is a word that could unironically describe me as I am now. I look like a completely different person than who I am. In ten years of lifting (nearly half of it on anabolic steroids, because I make great life choices), I haven't missed more than three consecutive days to a week, ever. Apparently my commitment issues don't extend to things that I can't cast as the author of some conspiracy theory designed to usurp my position on a Discord server with 20 total members. But alas, being anything jacked is better than being the same person fat. At least, that's all I have for an answer when people ask me why I do this or look this way.

Before I lose you, this is all relevant because I'm still very lazy and avoidant, yet I found a complete success story in fitness. In fact, I'm actually totally happy and content in life, optimistic for the future, and feel completely fulfilled. Almost forgot to tell you why you should take this seriously for a second. This manifesto is for beginners or people who are scared to take the leap, or confused about what to do. It's for people who maybe started, or got close to starting, or maybe you're just struggling with whether this is even what you want.

Now here's my shocking revelation: they take an extremely simple concept, and make it impossibly complex, and then confuse themselves with an overwhelming concept, when in reality you are thinking too much about picking shit up and typing what you eat into Cronometer. (No, you shouldn't recommend me MFP or another app, because your app sucks and you are wrong to use it.)

I'm writing this during a particularly manic alignment of my elements and I've been slowly evacuating all social media platforms because they all play boss music now. But I feel like posting my philosophy here when I remember that I've been jacked for ten years, and I probably make sense. I wanted to document my thoughts before I enter ravenous mode in a process not dissimilar to Fuchi from Junji Ito's anthologies.

## The Heresy of Movement Substitution

Let's begin with something appropriately scandalous: replacing the holy barbell back squat with the pedestrian dumbbell goblet squat. Sounds like fitness apostasy, but bear with me while I explain why this isn't a crime against humanity—because this is not satire.

The immediate objection is obvious: you can't load a goblet squat like you can a back squat, therefore your legs are being tragically underserved. This assumes your body operates like some sort of accountant, meticulously tracking the exact poundage you're pushing and filing quarterly reports on your progress.

**Here's the uncomfortable truth: your body is remarkably stupid.** It doesn't know what exercise you're performing, how much weight you're lifting, and shockingly, it doesn't know how to count independent of your parietal lobe, so how many reps you do is a concept beyond comprehension here. Your body only registers stress, fatigue, and whether you're asking it to adapt to something progressively more challenging.

Progressive overload isn't just adding plates—it's tempo manipulation, range of motion expansion, pause reps, time under tension, or simply adding volume. In fact, progressive overload is so much more, it is a weapon. We are at war with Homeostasis and it is our weapon.

Your muscles don't have access to your training log; they only know whether they're being systematically tortured in a forward-trending manner. So when you count each set to your perfect rep, that's fine—nothing wrong with counting—but it's also very non-linear with your actual workload. This becomes a bigger problem when you hate the movements you're doing, because you'll just cheat to get to that number.

I know we all try to avoid doing that, but face it: form breaks under pressure, and you want to end it. If you cared about form, you'd fail the count more often than you barely scrape it out. Your muscle has no idea what the hell you're doing this entire time. You're just playing a weird counting game for no reason. Look, I'm not saying reps are useless. I'm not genuinely trolling. I'm just saying that for the target audience of this post, they're probably useless. You need to have a mind-muscle connection to use them correctly.

I lied and ended up accidentally revealing a controversial opinion anyway, but the impact of mind-muscle connection as a concept ties back into my original point, I swear. The problem here is that beginners don't have it. They also don't understand the titanic and foundational role it plays. It takes time to develop that, and all of these beginner programs are designed with a rep count that relies on it.

What I'm saying is, I have two beginners. They're lifting the same weight. One does 8 reps, one does 15. Who's burned their muscle out more? I have no idea, but I can tell you who's more likely to have been pretty gassed when they potentially had more muscle to push that with, because if you're just moving things in the most tension-avoidant way possible, you're accidentally doing cardio, man.

To explain the concept of mind-muscle connection to someone who doesn't have it from my perspective after a decade: I can do the exact same movement, with the exact same form—let's use close-grip bench press as an example. I can do it with the exact same weight and for the exact same amount of reps too. In fact, if you look at me, I am doing the exact same thing. However, for half of those reps, I have targeted the fuck out of my triceps, which are burning, and the other half, I've alleviated that with my shoulders.

Funny how I can do the exact same thing, but work two different muscles independently, huh? Black magic? Or, mind-muscle connection. You don't need to do cool party tricks like that either. You're just capable of actually communicating directly with your muscles using your brain—it's just a bit of a rusty talent these days, but it only takes a little while to wake back up, and it remains an essential thing to focus on being mindful of.

**The radical proposition:** Any movement can be substituted for any other, provided you maintain the fundamental principle of making the same muscles stressed and fatigue in increasingly creative ways and with an appropriate distribution of volume and intensity. Funny how often you see people doing weekly volume that is just completely random. I don't know why they do that, neither do they. Nobody knows why they're doing that. I don't tell them they're wrong however, and you think I would. They're not Jay Cutler target sculpting the long-head of his tricep for a show. They're at the gym, lifting, and they're enjoying it, so that's exactly what they should be doing. They'll figure out their volume when it matters to them more. This brings me to my ultimate point: the best routine is the one you'll actually execute consistently, not the one that looks most impressive in a peer-reviewed journal.

## You Won't Change in One Month

Here's where I become insufferably preachy: none of your optimization matters without long-term consistency. The gym should feel like a reliable friend, not an abusive relationship you keep returning to out of masochistic habit. It doesn't take a month, six months, a year—try two years, longer. Don't rush this.

If your routine feels like a chore, you've already lost. We don't do chores when we're sick, tired, or experiencing a psychotic episode where we are inside the Truman Show. But we should still lift on those bad days, unless you're genuinely suffering rather than just practicing recreational self-pity.

**The biggest lie ever told:** "No pain, no gain." This is motivational cancer. You don't need to starve yourself into a caloric concentration camp or become some sort of disciplinary monk to achieve basic human fitness. Anyone can do this—the problem is the knowledge gap and how fitness influencers profit from your confusion.

Just be careful with shoulders and pain. Lifting should never, ever, ever hurt. It should feel tight, but not painful. If you feel pain, ever, at any point **stop what you are doing immediately**. I would recommend treating your tendons like they are a muscle, especially in your shoulders. I do 10 to 15 mins of rotator cuff warmups and rotations before any chest or shoulder day. **If you think this is extra or pointless now, or I'm being cautious, you are wrong and you will regret it**. DO your warmups. One day you'll get injured and you will be thinking damn, that was fucking preventable.

In ten years, my longest break was only because my entire fucking throat got slit open and I had to be on a morphine drip for a week, and it's not because I'm disciplined, but because I've structured my approach around sustainable mediocrity rather than unsustainable excellence. I have a massive fuck off anime scar across my throat now too, so that week wasn't all bad, it fits my gymcel aesthetic like triplesixdelete fits SoundCloud rappers that want to be Sid Vicious.

## The Jeff Nippard Contradiction

I've experimented with every training philosophy—push/pull/legs, full body, powerlifting, strongman, whatever boutique methodology was trending that week. Currently, I run a classic bro split, which is apparently unfashionable among people who take themselves seriously.

Jeff Nippard will have every beginner running optimised PHUL or PPL beginner routines because he is Jeff Nippard. You are not Jeff Nippard. This guy is seriously fucking locked in. I don't even believe you need to run a beginner routine at first. Maybe some people, but just go with Coolcicada's PPL or some kind of Intermediate routine and maybe remove deads or squats on one of your cycles. Replace deads with something like pendlay rows for example, and replace squats with something like leg press. This is not to say you shouldn't do those movements if you can, it's just the only thing I can see actually rocking your CNS as a beginner.

Yes, higher frequency training is theoretically (okay, coping, absolutely) superior for hypertrophy. But my bro split has produced consistently impressive results because—and this is crucial—I actually enjoy it. Enjoyment is the ultimate performance enhancer. I am consistent because if I don't like doing something, I do something else. Complex made simple. Amazing.

**Let me cook:** I follow target volume and intensity for each muscle group, but keep the specific exercises fluid. I might go to gym on back day thinking, I'll do lats for x sets and rear delts for x sets. This dynamic approach forces me to remain mindful rather than robotically executing predetermined sets and reps. I know when I've achieved meaningful overload because it should be immediately obvious when you've completed productive work.

As a beginner you might be thinking, how do you know what movements are effective? My answer is that I still do not believe in movements. If I'm pulling something down, my lats are being stressed. I can feel that however I do it. If I'm pulling something horizontally, again, I can feel that in my rear delts. It is again, very simple.

I don't count reps at all—instead focusing on tension and proximity to failure. Counting hampers my ability to feel what's actually happening in the muscle being trained. I can't stop myself shooting for a number of reps if I have a number in my head. This number serves no purpose and it doesn't need to be there. Do slow movements. If you can't feel the muscle, waste of time. Unless you're oly lifting and training explosive power, momentum is never a good thing. Avoid it like the plague. If you can lift something, but you can't control it all the way, it is too heavy for you to lift. You can pick it up I agree, but it is too heavy for you, put it back down and control something lighter.

## The Programming Industrial Complex

There's an entire physiological universe of muscle fiber types, optimal loading parameters, and anatomical considerations. This information is factually correct and potentially useful if exercise science is your intellectual hobby. But if you're learning kinesiology to get bigger muscles, you're probably missing the forest for the mitochondria.

I train without regard for calendar weeks because the human body operates on biological time, not social constructs. I lift 7 days a week, until I feel like I need a rest day. If Jeff Nippard tells you that you will die without a rest day, but you feel like you are fine, it's probably because you are not going to die if you go to gym. You will know. I also don't ever skip a workout. If my next workout is leg day and I take a rest day, then after the rest day it is still going to be leg day.

I see newer lifters obsessively consuming educational content from people whose livelihood depends on making simple concepts appear complex. When your business model requires content creation, complexity becomes profitable even when simplicity would be more effective. These aren't bad people spreading misinformation—they're responding to economic incentives. But they often miss the fundamental point: most people need sustainable habits, not optimal spreadsheets.

**Observation from the field:** Visit your gym's five biggest members and you'll discover five completely different training philosophies. They're large because they're consistent, they've found sustainable enjoyment in the process, and they understand that showing up matters more than optimization.

## The Pharmaceutical Confession (Proceed with Existential Dread)

Yes, I use performance-enhancing drugs and have been on "TRT+" for four years (okay, sometimes Mast in the summer because I feel like a pretty princess). I started when I was 20, and I will tell you now that it was an incredibly stupid decision I never should have made. I don't regret it because of my circumstances, but if you have a family, a life, other things to live for, my story wouldn't be the same in your eyes. Am I going to stop? Nope. But here's the thing: I'm not here to convince you it's okay.

My only advice: if you have questions, the answer is no. There should be zero ambiguity, no "risks you're willing to take," no rumors you're investigating. You should possess complete understanding of the physiological, psychological, and legal implications before consideration begins.

This isn't recreational pharmacology—it's permanent biochemical modification across multiple hormonal pathways, permanently in cases. If you need to ask questions of internet strangers, you lack the foundational knowledge required for informed consent. When it comes to endocrinology, my usual laid-back philosophy becomes its own antithesis.

Wanting to be bigger, more attractive, or more confident are normal human desires, not medical indications for hormone therapy. You might have overdosed on Xanax once, or 20 times, and woke up in the ER. That's getting lucky. But you're not taking a drug here. This is fucking with your biochemistry. You do not get lucky. You thrive, and benefit, or you burn. 

For 99% of you reading this, just because I made a dumb choice and don't regret it, you have to remember what I am not regretting. Injections every other day for the rest of my life. A GP onboard and monitoring my bloods and getting EKGs every 3 months (which still wouldn't catch potential LVH btw). I'm healthy, but from what I can see. Therein lies the difference. If you're getting on a stage, go for it. If you wanna look good or get laid, bro there are easier ways to do that than even lifting in the first place, you do not need this shit.

Take it from a gymcel that a greek body does not fix your negative rizz. Girls won't throw themselves at you lil bro. Being a gymcel is about being a grotesque freak. You don't want this.

## Nutritional Reality: Volume Over Virtue

Dietary adherence follows the same principles as training consistency—sustainability trumps optimization. You can construct a diet that doesn't feel like punishment.

**The fundamental insight:** You're not hungry for calories, you're hungry for volume. During cutting phases, I consume kilograms of frozen berries weekly—high satiety, low energy density, psychologically satisfying. If you're constantly telling yourself what you can't eat, your diet is architecturally flawed.

Establish consistent meal patterns and snack on high-volume, low-calorie foods. Artificial sweeteners are your allies, not your enemies. Yes, artificial sweeteners are fine; the dystopian cyberpunk future hasn't arrived where a Diet Coke gives you mutant offspring. They help a ton when you're craving something sweet without blowing your calorie budget.

Track your intake accurately using Cronometer, because subjective portion estimation is where good intentions go to die. If you're just guessing, you're basically writing nutrition fan-fiction. Reality check: most people are horrendous at estimating calories. Measuring might be tedious, but it's the difference between thinking you're in a deficit and actually being in one.

**Metabolic mythology:** Claims about fast or slow metabolism affecting significant weight changes are largely fantasy. Barring thyroid disorders, you're simply consuming more or fewer calories than you estimate. Metabolism affects day-to-day fluctuations, not long-term body composition trends. If you're not tracking accurately, you're not dieting scientifically. The alternative explanation is that you're violating thermodynamics, in which case you should contact research institutions rather than fitness forums.

## The Psychological Hazards of Physical Improvement

Fitness culture has a tendency to colonize personality, transforming reasonable people into self-righteous evangelists. One day you're just a guy who goes to the gym, and the next you're a full-blown fitness cultist, preaching the gospel of gains to anyone within earshot. Trust me, nobody likes the dude who brings up his macros and squat PR at every conversation. 

Remember that others don't share your enthusiasm for systematic self-improvement, and that's perfectly acceptable. Physical development should enhance your humanity, not replace it. Muscles are cool, but so are friends, hobbies, and not being a single-minded bore.

Be careful with chasing praise. External validation becomes addictive—the praise is poison if you let it define your self-worth. If your self-worth starts to revolve entirely around flexing in good lighting and fishing for 'damn bro, you look huge' comments, you're setting yourself up for a bad time. You're more than your biceps, and if you forget that, you'll end up insecure and constantly needing your next fix of approval.

You can become so precious about your physique that you trap yourself in a cage of your own construction. If you can't eat a slice of pizza at your best friend's birthday because *"ugh, the macros,"* or you get anxious about missing a single workout, take a step back. You've accidentally built a prison out of chicken breast and iron plates. Don't trap yourself in it. The goal is to improve your life, not to isolate yourself on Mount Olympus of Swoleness, alone with your 'perfect' body and no one around who cares.

## Final Thoughts for Critics

If you've read this far and find it objectionable, excellent—intellectual disagreement is more interesting than consensus. If you haven't read it but still hate it, I'm genuinely curious about your cognitive architecture.

This philosophy isn't universal. It's specifically designed for people like me—former fat kids who grew up socially isolated, who dropped out of physical education, who spent decades convinced they weren't genetically eligible for physical competence. It's for people who would endure more psychological suffering avoiding fitness than embracing it.

If you're bigger, stronger, or more experienced than me, fantastic—I have nothing to prove and everything to learn. If you want to engage in internet posturing, that seems like an exhausting way to spend your finite time on earth, but I appreciate the performance art aspect.

If you want to have an actual conversation about why I'm wrong, I'm genuinely interested in alternative perspectives, provided you can articulate them without resorting to tribal displays of dominance. I don't do any kind of fighting sports. You can probably beat my ass if you do MMA or something. We are typing on a computer.

If you want to see photos of me, I don't really care enough to post them because I think it takes away from the point I'm trying to make. But here's an image of me attempting the Sergio Oliva pose from a progress posing video recently (I record this daily): https://imgur.com/a/lrClL96 - I think this photo is quite symbolic due to how goofy I look and it's ony my Desktop, so might aswell.
